Project2 Report

Group Members: Will Duff and Triton Eden
- We all worked on stl and qsort together
- I finished the stl and qsort, and fixed it from having a new, unnecessary list
- Triton and Will worked on quick sort and merge
- Triton finished up with the benchmark requirements

Overall we worked well as a team, and it's nice to work together at one time
on the same laptop to collaborate on the same problem at once. We didn't break
up each sorting algorithm between each other too much, only when we needed to
fix or make one of them better.
