This challenge went well, I am enjoying learning a new skill and I find Unity to be pretty intuitive and impressive.
I will continue to learn the workings of Unity from tutorials. Once I have gained sufficient knowledge I will begin work on the full project.
Once we have finalized our story concepts we will find or create the suitable assets needed for it. 
Then I will probably start working on level design and character abilities.
