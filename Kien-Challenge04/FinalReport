The plan of our group is to create a 2D, platforming, "metroidvania" style game in the Unity game engine. We are planning
to each learn from Unity for about a few weeks through tutorials. Then, we will brainstorm and develop the game using that knowledge.
(All of my stuff is in a separate branch named KienKong-Tutorial, all of the coding is in scripts)

Rubric:
20 pts: the game is playable
10 pts: It is clear that the project passed the required hours
10 pts: Effort is shown from each individual's task
(40 points total)
